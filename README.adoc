= Tracing Workbench

This projects allows to tinker with tracing by providing some services that report to a Jaeger tracing backend.

== Configure Docker

In order to calculate dependencies set the memory that is available for docker to at leas 2.5GiB.

== Starting the application

1. Build with `./gradlew build`
1. Start with `docker-compose up -d`

If you want to force a re-build of images (in particular the text_db-seed image) run `docker-compose build`.

== Accessing Jaeger UI

The UI of Jaeger is available at: http://localhost:16686/search

== Usage

=== Create a new novel

`curl -v -X POST http://localhost:9080/novels`
 The `Location` header of the response will contain the URI where the generated
document can be retrieved.
